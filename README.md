~~Made this [website](https://sonicrules11.github.io/Warlauke/) for learning purposes since i've been quite interested in HTML, CSS, and JS for a while now. Currently the website does not have any buttons to check out other pages but you can use different URLs based on the folders, [this page has a link to most of the shit on the website](https://sonicrules11.github.io/Warlauke/info/index.html)~~

~~The "code" is pretty fucking messy, so don't bitch at me about it being messy. ik it is.~~
